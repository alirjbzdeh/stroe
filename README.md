#some bugs i had not enough time to fix : 
#1 - navbar update when route changes for changing navFIlters and Nav Links (i usually make new layouts for diffrent navs and in this place this is the best solution i think)
#2 - caching the card product(i could do it by using vueUse library but i didnt had the time and also usually there is a backend API that u can request and get that data #from so caching thing like Cart items isnt a good thing to do)
#3 - an static page for single product
